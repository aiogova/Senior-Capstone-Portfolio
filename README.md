# Senior Portfolio

## Overview
This is a portfolio of a few projects that I've made over my years at the University of St. Thomas. I've brought together four projects that were most notable to me. Below, I have a list of each project, with links to each project's own GitHub repository. Below that, I also describe each project and talk about why I included it here.
