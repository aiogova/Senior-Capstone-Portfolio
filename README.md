# Senior Portfolio

## Overview
This is a portfolio of a few projects that I've made over my years at the University of St. Thomas. I've brought together four projects that were most notable to me. Below, I have a list of each project, with links to each project's own GitHub repository. Below that, I also describe each project and talk about why I included it here.

## Creative Coding Project

I made this creative coding project during the second semester of my freshman year. I still didn't know all that much about programming when I made it, but I had a lot of fun along the way. I was actually taking my first object-oriented Java class (CISC 230) at the same time as I took the creative coding course, so I was learning new concepts on the fly. The creative coding class was really fun, and it showed me how programming can be used in creative and artistic fields. We are so used to programming being used functionally, but this class opened my eyes to programming being used creatively and artistically. I didn't know that programming could be an art form. 

For my project, I made a game called "Hamster Escape" where you play as a hamster trying to escape cat paws. It was inspired by Flappy Bird, as the hamster is like the bird, and the cat paws are like the pillars. The cat paws move randomly due to the use of Perlin noise, and you have to move the hamster up and down to dodge them. I love hamsters, and I love video games, so this project just felt like the right choice for my project. It's not meant to be taken too seriously, as it is just a silly and fun little game. All in all, it was a really enjoyable project to make, and it showed me how fun programming can be and how it can be used in entertainment.
