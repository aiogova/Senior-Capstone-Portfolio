# Senior Portfolio

## Overview
This is a portfolio of a few projects that I've made over my years at the University of St. Thomas. I've brought together four projects that were most notable to me. Below, I have a list of each project, with links to each project's own GitHub repository. Below that, I also describe each project and talk about why I included it here.

## Projects Included

- [Personal Website Project](https://github.com/aiogova/aiogova.github.io)
- [Creative Coding Project](https://github.com/aiogova/Hamster-Escape)
- [Game Design Project](https://github.com/aiogova/Cooking-for-the-Common-Good)
- [Game Production Project](https://github.com/aiogova/Carrying-Anxiety)

## Personal Website Project
- [Personal Website Project](https://github.com/aiogova/aiogova.github.io)

I created this project for my web development class during my senior year of college. It is a personal website consisting of a home page, projects page, resume page, and a “fun stuff” page. Built using HTML and CSS, this site was designed to serve as a professional online presence that I could share with potential employers.

In addition to implementing the technical aspects of front-end development, I focused heavily on organization, clarity, and usability. The layout and navigation were intentionally kept simple to make it easy for recruiters to quickly find relevant information, such as my projects and resume. This project allowed me to practice structuring content effectively, applying consistent styling across multiple pages, and thinking critically about how design choices impact user experience.

This was my first project in my web development class, but it provides a foundation that I can continue to expand and refine as I gain more experience and add new projects to my portfolio.

## Creative Coding Project
- [Creative Coding Project](https://github.com/aiogova/Hamster-Escape)


I created this project during my freshman year in a creative coding course. At the time, I was still early in my programming journey and learning many concepts for the first time. I was simultaneously taking my first object-oriented Java course (CISC 230), which meant I was often applying newly learned ideas as I went. Despite the challenges, this project was an enjoyable and formative experience.

The creative coding class was really fun, and it showed me how programming can be used in creative and artistic fields. We are so used to programming being used functionally, but this class opened my eyes to programming being used creatively and artistically. I didn't realize that programming could be an art form. 

For my project, I made a game called "Hamster Escape", in which the player controls a hamster attempting to avoid incoming cat paws. Inspired by Flappy Bird, the gameplay involves moving the hamster up and down to dodge obstacles. The movement of the cat paws is randomized using Perlin noise, adding variation and unpredictability to each playthrough. I love hamsters, and I love video games, so this game just felt like the right choice for my project. It's not meant to be taken too seriously, as it is a silly and fun little game. 

All in all, it was a really enjoyable project to make, and it showed me how fun programming can be and how it can be used in entertainment.

## Game Design Project
- [Game Design Project](https://github.com/aiogova/Cooking-for-the-Common-Good)

I created this project in my game design class during my sophomore year of college. As part of a team, I worked on developing a game aimed at contributing to the common good. Our team created an educational game focused on eating disorders and healthy ways to address them, titled "Cooking for the Common Good".

The game was developed in GameMaker using GML (GameMaker Language). I served as the sole programmer on the team, while my teammates were responsible for art and sound design. Working on a collaborative project of this scope gave me valuable experience in communication, teamwork, and time management, as well as an understanding of how different roles contribute to a shared creative goal.

As the sole programmer on the team, being responsible for all programming aspects of the project provided extensive hands-on experience. I frequently encountered technical challenges and bugs, but working through these issues strengthened my problem-solving abilities and deepened my understanding of game development. Through iterative playtesting and debugging, I was able to refine both gameplay mechanics and overall stability.

Overall, this project was both challenging and rewarding, and it played an important role in developing my technical programming skills alongside essential collaboration and communication skills.

## Game Production Project
- [Game Production Project](https://github.com/aiogova/Carrying-Anxiety)

I made this project in my game production class, also during my sophomore year of college. Once again, I had to work with a team to produce a game that aimed at contributing to the common good. This time, our team chose to create an educational game about social anxiety, intended to help players understand what living with social anxiety can feel like and how it can be addressed. We called it "Carrying Anxiety". While the game development began with a serious educational goal, it ultimately evolved into a more light-hearted, adventure-style experience.

Once again, I was the sole programmer on my team, while my teammates were in charge of art and sound design. We made the project in GameMaker using GML again. Because I had already gone through a similar collaborative development process in my game design project, this project allowed me to build upon and refine the skills I had previously developed rather than learning them from scratch. I approached communication, collaboration, and time management with greater confidence and professionalism.

From a technical standpoint, this project further strengthened my programming skills in GameMaker using GML. While many of the core concepts were familiar, I was able to apply them more efficiently and thoughtfully, spending less time learning fundamentals and more time improving structure, debugging, and playtesting. Overall, this project reinforced and deepened both my technical and interpersonal skills, demonstrating clear growth from my earlier game design experience.
