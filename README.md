# Senior Portfolio

## Overview
This is a portfolio of a few projects that I've made over my years at the University of St. Thomas. I've brought together four projects that were most notable to me. Below, I have a list of each project, with links to each project's own GitHub repository. Below that, I also describe each project and talk about why I included it here.

## Creative Coding Project
- [Creative Coding Project](https://github.com/aiogova/Hamster-Escape)

I made this project during the second semester of my freshman year of college in my creative coding class. I still didn't know all that much about programming when I made it, but I had a lot of fun along the way. I was actually taking my first object-oriented Java class (CISC 230) at the same time as I took the creative coding course, so I was learning new concepts on the fly. The creative coding class was really fun, and it showed me how programming can be used in creative and artistic fields. We are so used to programming being used functionally, but this class opened my eyes to programming being used creatively and artistically. I didn't know that programming could be an art form. 

For my project, I made a game called "Hamster Escape" where you play as a hamster trying to escape cat paws. It was inspired by Flappy Bird, as the hamster is like the bird, and the cat paws are like the pillars. The cat paws move randomly due to the use of Perlin noise, and you have to move the hamster up and down to dodge them. I love hamsters, and I love video games, so this project just felt like the right choice for my project. It's not meant to be taken too seriously, as it is just a silly and fun little game. 

All in all, it was a really enjoyable project to make, and it showed me how fun programming can be and how it can be used in entertainment.

## Game Design Project
- [Game Design Project](https://github.com/aiogova/Cooking-for-the-Common-Good)

I made this project in my game design class during my sophomore year of college. I had to work with a team to produce a game that aims at contributing to the common good. So we made an educational game about eating disorders. It's supposed to educate people on eating disorders and healthy ways to deal with them.

We made the game in GameMaker, using GML (GameMaker Language) to write the code. I was the sole programmer on my team, while my teammates were in charge of art and sound design. Working on a group project like this gave me a lot of experience in effectively communicating and collaborating with other team members, and managing teamwork on a large-scale project. I feel that I have learned a lot of useful life skills throughout the development of this project. 

Being the sole programmer for this entire project also gave me a lot of hands-on programming experience. It would sometimes get frustrating whenever I'd get stuck or something wasn't working, but figuring out how to get something to work the way we wanted was always so rewarding. I had to do a lot of playtesting and debugging, which further enhanced my technical skills. 

All in all, this project gave me lots of experience in both my technical skills and my soft skills.
